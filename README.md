# Introduction to Go Language

## Overview
Go, also known as Golang, is an open-source programming language developed by Google. It is designed for fast, simple, and reliable software development. Go is characterized by its simplicity, efficiency, and excellent support for concurrency.

## Built-in Types
Go includes several built-in data types to support various data processing needs:

- **bool**: Boolean type, which can be either true or false.
- **string**: String type, consisting of Unicode characters.
- **int, int8, int16, int32, int64**: Integer types of varying sizes.
- **uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, uintptr**: Unsigned integers of varying sizes, representing non-negative values.
- **float32, float64**: Floating-point numbers for representing real numbers.
- **complex64, complex128**: Complex numbers, consisting of two float types (real and imaginary parts).
- **byte**: Equivalent to uint8, often used in data processing.
- **rune**: Equivalent to int32, used for representing Unicode characters.

## Built-in Functions
Go language includes several functions that support the operation of built-in types and data structures:

- **append**: Adds elements to the end of a slice.
- **cap**: Returns the capacity of a slice, array, or channel.
- **close**: Closes a channel.
- **complex**: Creates a complex number from two floating-point numbers.
- **copy**: Copies elements from one slice to another.
- **delete**: Removes a key from a map.
- **len**: Returns the length of the argument.
- **make**: Creates a slice, map, or channel.
- **new**: Allocates memory for a value matching a type.
- **panic**: Interrupts normal function execution.
- **real, imag**: Returns the real or imaginary part of a complex number.
- **recover**: Helps to recover normal program execution after a panic.
