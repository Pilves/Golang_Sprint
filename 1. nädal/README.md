# Go Programming: Week 1 Learning Modules

Welcome to the Week 1 collection of Go programming modules. This series introduces the fundamentals of Go (Golang), guiding you through control structures, variable data types, and more, to lay a solid foundation for your journey with this powerful language.

## ðŸ“š File Descriptions

- **ConditionalsLoops.go**: This file provides a deep dive into Go's decision-making structures, explaining how to use conditionals (`if`, `else`) and iterations (`for` loops) to dictate program logic. It includes functions to determine the negativity of a number, compare integer and float values, discern seasons from months, sum numbers up to a given limit, and explore the alphabetical range between two characters. It's a compendium of exercises ranging from basic to intermediate levels, complete with scenarios that handle edge cases like division by zero or identifying leap years.


- **DataTypesVariablesCalculations.go**: This file is a practical tutorial on managing data in Go. It includes functions for basic arithmetic operations, mean calculations using floating-point numbers, type conversion with rounding, string manipulation through concatenation, and character manipulation by shifting positions within the alphabet. Additionally, it showcases the intriguing task of reversing alphabet values, a delightful twist on character encoding.

- **exam.go**: A test of logical reasoning and problem-solving in Go, this file contains functions that generate a chessboard pattern of squares, calculate the number of years required to reach a financial goal with compound interest, and optimize the calculation for efficiency. It demonstrates conditional logic and iteration over ranges, providing clear examples of algorithmic thinking and Go's mathematical capabilities.

- **GoingInDepth.go**: Delving into the intricacies of Go, this file introduces advanced manipulation of the Latin alphabet and numerical computations. It includes creating alphabetical sequences, reversing the alphabet with customizable steps, pairing numbers in ascending order, generating numerical combinations and triplets, and advanced countdowns. This file also tackles the challenge of converting numeric strings to integers, emphasizing Go's versatility in handling different data types and complex logic.

- **interestMonths.go**: This file offers a practical application of financial calculations within Go, focusing on compound interest computed monthly. The function `InterestWithMonths` calculates how many years and months it will take to grow an initial investment to a target amount given a yearly interest rate. It provides an excellent example of using loops for financial modeling and includes conditions to handle monthly calculations, making it a valuable resource for those interested in financial software development.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run the programs, you'll need the Go runtime environment. If you haven't installed it yet, download it from [the official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

After setting up Go, run the programs using your terminal:

```sh
go run <file-name>.go
```
Remember to substitute `<file-name>` with the specific name of the program file you wish to run.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes
Upon completing this module, you will have developed a clear understanding of:

- Go's fundamental syntax and the structural framework of its programs.
- How to employ conditional constructs and iterative loops to guide program logic.
- The process of declaring, initializing, and manipulating variables, as well as executing arithmetic operations.
- The methods for compiling and executing Go programs with proficiency.
