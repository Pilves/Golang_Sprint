# Go Programming: Week 1 Learning Modules

Welcome to the Week 1 collection of Go programming modules. This series introduces the fundamentals of Go (Golang), guiding you through control structures, variable data types, and more, to lay a solid foundation for your journey with this powerful language.

## ðŸ“š File Descriptions

- **ConditionalsLoops.go**: Introduces the core control structures like `if`, `else`, and `for` loops, demonstrating how to direct the flow of a Go program.

- **DataTypesVariablesCalculations.go**: Explores the various data types in Go, variable declarations, and basic arithmetic operations, setting the stage for complex computation.

- **exam.go**: Designed to evaluate your understanding of Go through quizzes and practical problems, reinforcing your learning experience.

- **GoingInDepth.go**: Dives deeper into Go, covering nuanced syntax and advanced practices for learners ready to elevate their Go expertise.

- **interestMonths.go**: Applies Go programming to real-world scenarios, such as calculating interest over time, showcasing the use of functions and user interactions.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run the programs, you'll need the Go runtime environment. If you haven't installed it yet, download it from [the official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

After setting up Go, run the programs using your terminal:

```sh
go run <file-name>.go
Remember to substitute `<file-name>` with the specific name of the program file you wish to run.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes
Upon completing this module, you will have developed a clear understanding of:

- Go's fundamental syntax and the structural framework of its programs.
- How to employ conditional constructs and iterative loops to guide program logic.
- The process of declaring, initializing, and manipulating variables, as well as executing arithmetic operations.
- The methods for compiling and executing Go programs with proficiency.
